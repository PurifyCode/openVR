# openVR
An HTML VR project for mobile devices. I'd recommend a phone. Supported browsers include Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Opera, and WebView for Android.
# What problem does this solve?
If you wanted a VR headset (ex. Quest 3) and you cant afford it; but you had a phone, you could use this to substitute a VR.
# What if I have a low-end phone?
I have been working on a custom renderer, which will be lightweight. It may work on phones that dont even support OpenGL or Vulkan.
# Why does this exist?
I have absolutely no idea.
